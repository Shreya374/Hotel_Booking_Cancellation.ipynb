# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## üìò Project Description

Many hotels lose revenue and face operational inefficiencies due to reservation cancellations. This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand what drives cancellations, and builds a predictive model to forecast which bookings are likely to be cancelled. This helps hotels make informed decisions‚Äîsuch as adjusting pricing, policies, and marketing‚Äîto reduce cancellation rates and improve room utilization.

## üéØ Key Objectives

* Explore historical booking data to identify patterns and factors that influence cancellations
* Engineer features that improve predictive capability (lead time, deposit type, special requests, etc.)
* Train, evaluate, and compare classification models to predict cancellations
* Derive actionable insights and recommendations for hotel operations

## üìÇ Dataset

* Source: ‚ÄúHotel Booking Cancellation‚Äù dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/youssefaboelwafa/hotel-booking-cancellation-multiple-models)
* Period: Includes bookings between \[start date] and \[end date]
* Size: Approx. *119,000* records, \~30‚Äë40 features (hotel type, number of guests, arrival dates, previous cancellations, deposit type, etc.)
* Key target variable: `is_canceled` (whether the booking was cancelled or not)

---

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values, correcting data types (dates, numeric vs categorical)
   * Removing or imputing features with many missing / redundant values
   * Feature engineering: e.g. combining arrival date parts, calculating stay duration, aggregating special requests

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualizing cancellation rates vs lead time, deposit type, hotel type, month / season
   * Analysing correlations, distributions, detecting outliers

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**

   * Splitting data into training & test sets
   * Trying multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
   * Hyperparameter tuning and cross‚Äëvalidation
   * Evaluating with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‚Äëscore, ROC‚ÄëAUC

4. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Which features are most predictive of cancellations
   * Operational suggestions: e.g. stricter deposit policies, adjusted pricing for high cancellation periods, loyalty incentives for low‚Äërisk customers

---

## üßÆ Expected / Example Findings

* Bookings with longer lead time have higher cancellation probability
* Non‚Äërefundable / no deposit bookings tend to have lower cancellation risk
* More special requests, or past cancellation history, are indicators of cancellation risk
* Cancellation rates vary by hotel type (city vs resort) and season/month

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

* Python (pandas, numpy)
* Visualization libraries: seaborn, matplotlib
* Machine learning: scikit‚Äëlearn, possibly XGBoost or Gradient Boosting
* Jupyter Notebook for exploration & modeling

---

## üìä How to Use This Repository

* Open the notebook file (e.g. `Hotel Booking Cancellation.ipynb`)
* Install required dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
* Run the notebook: data load ‚Üí preprocessing ‚Üí EDA ‚Üí model building ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí conclusions
* Check the saved model (if any) for inference on new data

---

## ‚ö† Limitations & Future Work

* Some features may be missing (e.g. external factors like holidays, weather, special events)
* Models may overfit if not properly validated
* The cost of wrong predictions (false positives / false negatives) may be asymmetric ‚Äî need cost‚Äêsensitive evaluation
* Possible improvements: more advanced models (e.g. XGBoost, ensemble methods), deployment as dashboard/web app, adding external datasets

---

## üí° Impact & Applications

Hotels can use predictions to:

* Adjust overbooking strategies to optimize occupancy
* Incentivize bookings from low‚Äërisk segments
* Design deposit/cancellation policies more intelligently
* Plan staffing and resource allocation more accurately
